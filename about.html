    <p> My name is Jessica Murphy and I am a Junior at the University of Rhode Island. I am majoring in Textiles, Merchandising and Designing with a double minor in Computer Science and Spanish. I am from Massachusetts so moving to Rhode Island was not a huge difference although, it is a beautiful state and I am so thakful I get to spend my college years here. I am looking forward to gaining my knowledge especially in Computer Science as the skills we learn in this class will help me a lot through life and with my dream career. I am very excited for the rest of my college years. </p>
